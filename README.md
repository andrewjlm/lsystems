Draw JSON lsystems in Bokeh

I was inspired by the (very awesome) [@LSystemBot](https://twitter.com/LSystemBot/media?lang=en) to create a program that could draw an LSystem from JSON input.

## Usage

```
python lsystem.py systems/test.json
```

This will create a `fig.html` file in your working directory and pop open a browser window displaying the system.
